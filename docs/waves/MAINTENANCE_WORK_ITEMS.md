# Waves Maintenance Work Items

Purpose: track maintenance, quality, and technical-debt work that should be folded into normal delivery.

Status keys:

- `todo`
- `in-progress`
- `blocked`
- `done`

## How To Use

1. Keep items scoped and testable.
2. Link each item to concrete files and acceptance checks.
3. Prefer pairing one maintenance item with each feature/contract ticket when feasible.

## Current Queue

Completed maintenance tickets are archived in:

- `docs/waves/MAINTENANCE_WORK_ITEMS_ARCHIVE.md`

- Keep active queues focused on executable work items only.
4. `Tests`:
- Manual consistency pass for active-vs-archive file boundaries, status markers, and README references.

- `browser/README.md`
- `engine-wasm/README.md`
- `transport-rust/README.md`
- `README.md`
3. `Build`:

- Keep updates additive and deterministic across layers.
4. `Tests`:
- Manual PR checklist verification against one representative ticket transition.
5. `Accept`:

- Run a docs reference sweep to replace stale file paths and module names after refactors (for example parser/module splits).
- Ensure file references in tickets remain specific enough to guide implementation but avoid dead-path drift.
4. `Tests`:
- Manual path-existence pass for referenced file paths in active and archive boards.
5. `Accept`:
- Board/readme file references resolve to existing paths or clearly intentional globs; no known dead file paths remain.

### M0-10 Archive index and movement policy

1. `Status`: `todo`
2. `Files`:
- `docs/README.md`
- `docs/waves/WORK_ITEMS.md`
- `docs/waves/WORK_ITEMS_ARCHIVE.md`
- `docs/waves/MAINTENANCE_WORK_ITEMS.md`
3. `Build`:
- Add a short “active vs archive” index entry in docs navigation and define when tickets move into archive files.
- Document that archived tickets are historical and reactivation requires new follow-up IDs on active boards.
4. `Tests`:
- Manual docs navigation pass from `docs/README.md` to active and archive boards.
5. `Accept`:
- Contributors can quickly locate active vs archived work boards and follow one consistent archival rule.
